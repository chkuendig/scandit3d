# Scandit Winter Hackathon 2019 Project.

## How to use
Try it out at http://***REMOVED***/scandit3d/. 
* Click once in the main area to start it (click a second time to go into fullscreen). 
* Once the game runs, you can add barcodes via the barcode generator. Selecting a new symbology or pressing enter automatically regenerates the barcode

* The **barcode scanner** is obviously the amazing [Scandit Barcode Scanner for the Web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scandit-sdk).

* The **barcode generator** used is [bwip-js](https://github.com/metafloor/bwip-js) which is a translation to native JavaScript of [Barcode Writer in Pure PostScript](https://github.com/bwipp/postscriptbarcode).

* The **3D maze** is based on the WebGL-port of the 3D Maze screensaver from Windows 95 available at [ibid-11962/Windows-95-3D-Maze-Screensaver](https://github.com/ibid-11962/Windows-95-3D-Maze-Screensaver). The matrix libraries it uses are from [esangel/WebGL](https://github.com/esangel/WebGL/tree/master/Common) and the maze generator can be found at [dstromberg2/maze-generator](https://github.com/dstromberg2/maze-generator).

* The **status bar** uses the UI elements from [NES.css](https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css) and the font is [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?selection.family=Press+Start+2P). 


* The **Scandit3D logo** uses the [AmazDooM font](https://www.dafont.com/amazdoom.font).
